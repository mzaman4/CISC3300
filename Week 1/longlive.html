<!-- Intro -->
	<h1><font color="Blue">Issues surrounding the web</font></h1>

	<p>Long Live the Web" by Tim Berners-Lee, is an article that discussed the web and what factors have threatened the evolution of the web.
<!--List -->
	<h3>Topics covered:</h3></p>

	<ul>
		<li>Universality</li>
		<li>Open Standards</li>
		<li>Seperation of Web and Internet</li>
		<li>Human Rights</li>
		<li>Snooping</li>
	</ul>

		<p> The first topic that caught my attention was Universality. I was made aware of the issue on how social media platforms can stagnate web growth by withholding user data.<br> I always viewed the web as a collection of websites, where each website was it's own seperate entity. However this article made me realize that this is not the case.<br> Websites contributing to the growth of the web as a whole is an interesting concept.  </p>

		<p>Human rights is another topic that caught my attention. Specifically net nuetrality. As we all know, net nuetrality was repealed. It is very sad how this fear existed in 2010<br> and yet the people who voted for the repeal did not understand how important net nuetrality is, not only as a right but also as a neccesity to improve and maintain the web. </p>
