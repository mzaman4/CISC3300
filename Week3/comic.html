	<p>The comic discusses the topic of Icons and what meaning they have. This chapter caught me by surprise. It went in depth on something I had not considered before. I took icons at face value as what they seek to represent as opposed to looking at it in its most literal sense. Although it made sense, it was a very weird and confusing concept to grasp. Regarding cartoons, the author makes a fascinating point when he asks, "Why would anyone, young or old, respond to a cartoon as much or more than a realistic image?" The highlighted relationship between oneself and a cartoon speaks volumes.</p>
